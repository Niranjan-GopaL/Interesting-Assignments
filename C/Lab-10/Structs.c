// This is a common way to define a new aggregate type called a structure
// Note that this is not a variable declaraction.
struct complex {
	float real;
	float imaginary;
};
// The above structure has two "field"s or "member"s called "real" and
// "imaginary" each of them is as good as a separate variable
// but clubbed together into one larger variable... we'll see an example

// After this is declared we can use "struct complex" as if it was a type.
// For example here is a global variable of the  type "struct complex":
struct  complex g;


// Two other examples of structure declarations
// (1) Note that the structure can contain other structures or arrays as well
// ... not just basic types. Eg "struct student" below:
struct student {
	char name[100];
	char marks;
	struct complex id;
};


// (2) Here is another interesting structure. In "struct list" below we have
// ... a pointer to a structure inside a structure.
struct list {
	int v;
	struct list * next;
};

// Here are some simple function definitions for structures
// .. suggestion: Come back to this after looking at main()
void read_complex( struct complex * v){
	scanf("%f %f",&v->real, &v->imaginary);
	// Alternately:
	// scanf("%f %f",&(*v).real, &(*v).imaginary);
}


void print_complex( const struct complex * v){
	printf("%f %f",(*v).real, (*v).imaginary);
}

void add_complex( const struct complex * u, 
		  const struct complex * v, struct complex *w){
	w->real  =  u->real  +  v->real;
	(*w).imaginary  =  (*u).imaginary  +  (*v).imaginary ;
}

// note that (*v).real and v->real are the same
void print_2_complex( const struct complex * v){
	printf("%f %f",v->real, v->imaginary);
}

void print_3_complex( const struct complex v){
	printf("%f %f",v.real, v.imaginary);
}



void main(){
  struct complex a,b,c;

  //1. Basics in three pieces
  //1.a   The members of structures are access with the "." operator
  //      Each field is like a variable but preceeded with the struct var name
  a.real=5;
  a.imaginary=10;
  printf("%f %f\n",a.real,a.imaginary);

  //1.b assignment works like for any other type (other than arrays)
  b = a;	// Try this !


  //1.c comparision doesnt work!
//   if ( a == b ) // Try this !
// 	  printf(" They are equal\n");
//   else
// 	  printf("They are not equal\n");

}

  /*
  //2. also we can have pointers to structures
  struct complex * p;
  p=&a;
  //3. Note that *p is a structure so it has real and imaginary parts
  //   To read in a structure we need to read field by field
  printf("%f %f\n", (*p).real, (*p).imaginary);
  // Note that we can replace (*p).real by p->real .. a C language convenience
  
  //4. We can also malloc structures
  p=malloc(sizeof(struct complex));
  p->real=50;
  p->imaginary=100;
  printf("%f %f\n", p->real, p->imaginary);

  /*
  //5. We can treat structure variables just like basic types and
  //   pass pointers to them for the functions to read, modify, etc:
  printf("\nGive me real and imaginary parts of the first number:");
  read_complex(&a);
  printf("\nGive me real and imaginary parts of the second number:");
  read_complex(&b);
  // we want to add   a  and  b  ,  putting the result in   c
  add_complex(&a,&b,&c);
  printf("\nReal and imaginary parts of the sum are:");
  print_complex(&c);
  */

  //6. We can also create arrays of structures, just like basic types 
  /*
  struct complex x[3];
  printf("\nGive me real and imaginary parts of the first number:");
  read_complex(&x[0]);
  printf("\nGive me real and imaginary parts of the second number:");
  read_complex(&x[1]);
  add_complex(&x[0],&x[1],&x[2]);
  printf("\nReal and imaginary parts of the sum are:");
  print_complex(&x[2]);
  */

  //7. We can also pass value (unlike arrays, but like other basic types)
  /*
  printf("\nReal and imaginary parts of the sum are (AGAIN):");
  // Note that we are passing a copy of a struct to be printed.
  print_3_complex(x[2]); 
  */

  //8. Just a note for those who know C++ or another object oriented language:
  // The concept of a "class" is nothing but a struct with
  // functions too added as fields/members.... think about it!
  // Of course, there are many other features of object-oriented languages.
   
  //9. Exercise
  // Define an array of complex  numbers.
  // Read into the array some number of complex numbers
  // Sort them using bubble sort. Use the code for bubble sort already available
